Overview
--------

QUAC ("Quantitative analysis of chatter" or any related acronym you like) is a
package for acquiring and analyzing social internet content. It can:

  * Reliably collect tweets from the Twitter Streaming API and convert them
    into a convenient and fast TSV format.

  * Estimate the origin location of tweets with no geotag.

Parallelism is implemented using various combinations of make, joblib, and a
simple map-reduce framework called "makereduce" which is included.

For more information:

  * Documentation is online at <http://reidpr.github.io/quac>. (Note: this may
    describe a different version of QUAC than the one you have.)

  * Current documentation is rooted at doc/index.html. You'll probably need to
    build it. The command for that is "cd sphinx && make". You will need
    Sphinx (http://sphinx-doc.org/) installed.

QUAC was formerly known as TWEPI ("Twitter for epidemic analysis").
