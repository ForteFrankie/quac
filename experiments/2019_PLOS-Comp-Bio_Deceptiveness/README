Prerequisites
=============

You will need Anaconda or Miniconda to set up the Python environment.

If you have trouble, let us know and we will try to help, but please realize
this code is unsupported.


Gathering the data
==================

This experiment requires four data sets. Three are provided in the
supplemental data; one you must download yourself.

The stated paths can be adjusted in "u.py".

Supplemental data
-----------------

Create a subdirectory called "data" and put the Excel spreadsheets S1 and S2
in it, and the S4 Python pickle file. (S3 will be computed on the fly as
"synthetic.xlsx"; we provide ours for comparison purposes.)

Google Health Trends data
-------------------------

Download this from Google. You need a Google Health Trends API key, which you
can get via Google's request form (citation 32).

Once you have the API key, you'll be given a document called "Health Trends
API Getting Started Guide". This contains a Python module; save that as
"ght_example.orig.py". Apply the patch "ght_example.patch" to create
"ght_example.py". (We cannot distribute Google's file because it does not have
a clear license.)

Create and activate a Conda environment using "environment2.yml". Note that
this environment is used only for downloading the Google data; a different one
is for the experiment.

Use the script "ght_get" to download the data. See the comment at the top of
the script for an example. Download two datasets:

  * Use the S2 spreadsheet to get "data/en+Influenza.ght.csv".
  * Use the S4 spreadsheet to get "data/misc.ght.csv".

Note that Google gives you a sample, so your results will differ slightly.


Running the experiment
======================

1. Review "u.py" to make sure paths and other parameters are appropriate for
   your system.

2. Create and active a Conda environment using "environment3.yml".

3. Run the experiment program to produce "data/out.pickle". This takes maybe
   20â€“30 minutes.

     $ ./experiment.py

4. Start Jupyter Notebook and load "figures.ipynb".

5. Run all cells. This takes a few minutes.

You should now have the figures (PDF) and tables (.tex).


Git notes
=========

* Derived files, the "data" directory, and ght_example*.py are ignored in
  .gitignore. If you want to include these in your fork, adjust that file.

* Output from Jupyter notebooks is embedded in *.ipynb files. Thus, simply by
  running the notebook, Git will see many megabytes of changes. Set up the
  script "nbstripout" as a Git filter to avoid this.
