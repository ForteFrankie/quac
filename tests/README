This directory contains the subset of tests which use the "cmdtest" framework.
These are shell scripts (which might be quite involved); standard output and
error are tested against expected values. "man cmdtest" for the details.

Test scripts can assume that pwd is this directory.

../test.sh runs all tests here. To run just one, say "cmdtest -t foo ."

You might be inclined to use "set -x" in your script to intermingle echoed
commands and output. The problem here is that it's not consistent which
command in a pipeline is printed first, so you'll get spurious failures. You
could try "echo" commands to make the output more digestible.

If cmdtest crashes with "NameError: global name 'errno' is not defined", that
means you need to make your test executable (there is a bug in the error
reporting).
