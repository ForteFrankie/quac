This directory contains tests using the "cmdtest" framework. These are shell
scripts (which might be quite involved); standard output and error are tested
against expected values. "man cmdtest" for the details.

Test scripts can assume that pwd is this directory.

../test.sh runs all tests here. To run just one, say "cmdtest -t foo ."

Note that the Python code contains tons of doctests as well. This isn't all
the testing we do.
