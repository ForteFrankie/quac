This directory contains tests that depend on a small data set of about 20,000
geotagged tweets. If this data set is not present, the tests are skipped.

The .id files in tweets/ contain the IDs of the tweets in the data set; it is
unfortunately your responsibility to acquire and preprocess these tweets. A
patch implementing a script to do so (it would take less than two days to
request them individually from the REST API) would be very welcome.

Note that we are flexible as to the specific tweets used, as long as the
tweets appeared in the streaming API spritzer during a period we were
listening. Feel free to adjust the tests to use better-accessible data.
