About QUAC
==========

QUAC ("Quantitative analysis of chatter" or any related acronym you like) is a
package for acquiring and analyzing social internet content. Features:

* Reliably collect tweets from the Twitter Streaming API and convert them into
  an easy-to-parse, de-duplicated, well-ordered, and fast TSV format.

* Estimate the origin location of tweets with no geotag. (But see `issue #15
  <https://github.com/reidpr/quac/issues/15>`_.)

* Careful preservation of Unicode throughout the processing pipeline.

* Various cleanup steps to deal with tweet quirks, including very rare ones
  (we've seen certain weirdnesses in only one of our 1.3+ billion tweets).
  That is, we deal with the special cases so you don't have to.

* Parallel processing using various combinations of Make, ``joblib``, and a
  simple map-reduce framework called QUACreduce which is included. (But see
  `issue #33 <https://github.com/reidpr/quac/issues/33>`_.)
